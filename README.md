# Array Methods Exercise Set

## How to complete the exercises

1. Pick an exercise. There is a file named `exercise-<number>.js` for each exercise where they are described and there is space to enter your implementation.
2. Run the command `npm test exercise-<number>.test.js` replacing the `<number>` with the number of the exercise you picked.
3. Start implementing your solution. Every time you save your file it will run the tests again.
4. Keep going until all tests are passing. If you are struggling try looking at the relevant test in the `exercise-<number>.test.js` file to see what it is expecting.
